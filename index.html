  <h1>More about me; a self interview.</h1>
  
  <h2>What's important to you?</h2>
  <p>My Family is the most important thing in the world to me. My wife and two children are all wonderful and we make a good team. While the world today can be scary, if you follow the trend lines and not the headlines you can see progress and hope. Our world is getting more peaceful and open. It's important to me that my children are positive, but also perseverant enough to overcome challenges that they will face.</p>
  
  <p>I love laughing. <span style="font-style:italic">If math is the universal language, laughter is the universal music</span>.</p>
  
  <p>The New York Islanders NHL team is more important to me than is probably reasonable. I am a big hockey fan. I like the Islanders, Bruins and any team playing against the Rangers.</p>
  
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>Building digital and real world things and reading. I'm trying to get better at brewing beer too.</p>
  
  <h2>What's your background?</h2>
  <p>I'm looking to take my almost twenty years of interactive game development and transition those skills the Front End Web Development.</p>
  
  <p>I've amassed a lot of skills in game development, including animation, technical art and general development skills. I've also served as a Manager, Director, Scrum Master and Product Owner.</p>
  
  <p>Most of my game development career has been in an Agency like setting. I manage people and production in a service group with multiple simultaneous clients and deadlines.</p>
  
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>Working with a team of people who create websites and user experiences. I really am interested in creating Art that combines the real world and the digital. I also love teaching. Something that combines all three of those would be my ideal!</p>
  
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I've been looping <a href="http://boardsofcanada.com/" target="_blank">Boards of Canada</a> and <a href="http://www.nikbaertsch.com/ronin/" target="_blank">Nik Bartschâ€™s Ronin</a> for the last couple months. I find both great music to have on while finding flow.</p>
